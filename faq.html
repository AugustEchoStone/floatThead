<h2>Frequent Issues</h2>

    <dl class="faq">
        <dt>plugin doesn't work when table is in a bootstrap3/jqueryui tab</dt>
        <dd>
            after version 1.2.12, this plugin should work within bootstrap3/jqueryui tabs by listening to tab change events. Make an issue if its still busted.
        </dd>

        <dt>The scrolling container has absolute position with <code>top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:0</code> css</dt>
        <dd>
            init plugin with <code>position:'fixed'</code> and see this example solution: <a href="https://github.com/mkoryak/floatThead/issues/205" target="_blank">issue 205</a>
        </dd>

        <dt>scroll container is not working (header does not float)</dt>
        <dd>
            scroll container should be the closest parent of table with <code>position:relative;overflow:auto;height:n px;</code>. If it is not, things wont work.
            The scroll container must be the container that scrolls <b>both</b> the x and y axis. It also helps if the container is as close to the table as possible (in terms of number of element between the scroll container and table)
        </dd>

        <dt>IE ONLY: header noticeably skips/jumps as you scroll</dt>
        <dd>
            I did a bit of IE researching and found that by unchecking IE's "Use smooth scrolling" setting, this issue no longer exists. You can do this by clicking the settings cog/gear -> Internet Options -> Advanced (tab) -> Browsing -> "Use smooth scrolling" (uncheck).

<h2>Plugin Best Practices</h2>
<p class="lead">Do this, and you will avoid a lot of headaches not just with this plugin, but with your layouts in general</p>

<div class="comment-body markdown-body markdown-format js-comment-body">
    <p>This plugin works by moving your table's header into a new table that it creates, it then floats that table in
        the correct position. In order to accomplish this the plugin expects a few things to be true:</p>


        <div class="alert alert-info alert-block">
            <strong>TLDR:</strong><br>
            Your table's styles must continue to style the newly created table which will live inside of a container div
            appended below your real table. The new table will have the same class(es) as your original table. <strong>The
                table must be visible when you run the plugin</strong>&nbsp;&longrightarrow;<small>If it is not, you will need to trigger a <code>reflow</code> event on it when it becomes visible.</small>

        </div>
    <hr/>

    <p>Ideal world:</p>

    <ul class="task-list">
        <li>Your table is visible when you run the plugin.</li>
        <li>Your table is styled via css on one of the table's DOM classes, and/or the styles work via a parent element.
            Example:
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight highlight-css"><pre><span class="pl-ent">table</span><span class="pl-e">.myTable</span> { ... }
<span class="pl-ent">div</span><span class="pl-e">.table-container</span> <span
                class="pl-ent">table</span> { ... }</pre>
    </div>

    <ul class="task-list">
        <li>The thead cells are also styled via non-inline css and the rules use element names or classes</li>
        <li>Your thead uses <code>th</code> tags for cells, otherwise you need to change the <code>cellTag</code> plugin
            option
        </li>
        <li>Your table does not make use of the <code>colgroup</code> element (though it is supported
            <strong>only</strong> if the number of <code>col</code> elements within <code>colgroup</code> match the
            number of columns in your table)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Will also work:</p>

    <ul class="task-list">
        <li>Your table uses inline css styles, or mixes inline styles with external styles described above.</li>
        <li>The thead cells may use the deprecated width attributes instead of css</li>
        <li>deprecated table attributes such as <code>cell-padding</code> and <code>cell-spacing</code> are supported
            but their use is discouraged
        </li>
        <li>Your table markup is straight up from 1998 (might work, but I will not help you if it doesn't)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Will <strong>not</strong> work:</p>

    <ul class="task-list">
        <li>Your table is styled via css rules on the table's DOM <code>id</code>
        </li>
        <li>Your thead cells are styled via similar id rules</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight highlight-css">
        <pre><span class="pl-e">#myTableRocks</span> <span class="pl-ent">td</span> { <span class="pl-mp"><span
                class="pl-s3">color</span></span>: <span class="pl-sc">blue</span>; }</pre>
    </div>

    <ul class="task-list">
        <li>Your table has invalid markup, such as unmatched number of columns in tbody, thead or tfoot</li>
        <li>Your table doesnt have a thead</li>
        <li>You want to float the <code>tfoot</code> element, but that is not supported right now</li>
        <li>Your table is hidden when you run the plugin so the column width calculations all fail.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
